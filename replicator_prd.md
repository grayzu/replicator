# Replicator - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Product Name:** Replicator  
**Vision Statement:** Enable general consumers to request and automatically print 3D objects using natural language, making 3D printing as simple as asking for what you need.

**Product Description:**  
Replicator is an intelligent 3D printing system that allows users to request objects using natural language and automatically handles the entire printing workflowâ€”from understanding the request to delivering the finished object. The system combines AI-powered natural language processing, 3D model sourcing and generation, and automated print management to create a seamless "Star Trek replicator" experience.

### Agent Communication Patterns

**Sequential Processing:** Most agents work in a defined sequence (Parser â†’ Search/Generation â†’ Assessment â†’ Slicing â†’ Queue â†’ Print â†’ Monitor â†’ Rating)

**Parallel Processing:** Some agents can work simultaneously (Search Agent and Generation Agent can both explore options)

**Event-Driven Communication:** Agents respond to events (print completion triggers Monitor Agent to notify Notification Agent)

**Feedback Loops:** Learning Agent receives data from all other agents to improve system performance

**Error Handling:** Each agent can communicate failures to appropriate recovery agents or escalate to user notification

This multi-agent architecture provides modularity, scalability, and clear separation of concerns while enabling complex workflows and intelligent decision-making throughout the print process.
